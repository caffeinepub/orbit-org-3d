  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive black-and-white theme overhaul with 3D elements across all sections. REQ-7, REQ-8, and REQ-9 are all substantially addressed. All sections (About, MissionVision, Services, Team, Contact, Hero) now include React Three Fiber 3D elements using only white/gray materials. The Navbar and Footer are monochrome. CSS variables, Tailwind config, and component styles use only black, white, and grayscale values. No significant missing requirements are detected; implementation is thorough and matches all acceptance criteria.",
